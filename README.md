A simple web app for selecting a location on the map and assigning a running / cycling activity with custom properties. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vanilla JavaScript. It also utilizes the Leaflet library for map functionality. After selecting a location on the map, the left-side panel updates automatically.
